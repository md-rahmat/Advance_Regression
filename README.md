<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
<b>Problem Statement:</b> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>Business objective:</b> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.<br> 
    
  <br>
    
<b>The housing company i.e., Surprise Housing wants to know the following:</b><br>
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house <br>
    - How well those variables describe the price of a house.<br>
    - Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

**<h3><u>Assignment Steps:</u></h3>**

**1.Data Understanding and Exploration**<br>
**2.Data Transformation**   
**3.Data Visualization**<br>
>Perform EDA to understand various variables.<br>
>Check the correlation between the variables.   

**4.Data Preparation**<br>
>Create dummy variables for all the categorical features.<br>
>Divide the data to train & Test.<br>
>Perform Scaling as required.<br>
>Divide data into dependent & Independent variables.
    
**5.Data Modelling & Evaluation**<br>
>Create Linear Regression model using mixed approach (RFE & VIF/p-value).<br>
>Validate the various assumptions of Linear Regression.<br>
>Check the Adjusted R-Square for both train & Test data.<br>
>Adopt Advanced Regresssion models such as Ridge or Lasso.<br>
>Report the final model,appropriate Lamda Value
